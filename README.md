## Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Data Science Dashboard project! This project leverages the power of Streamlit to create an interactive, real-time dashboard for data analysis and visualization. The dashboard is designed to provide key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual insights from a dataset, updating in near real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Updates**: The dashboard simulates live data updates, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data based on job categories, allowing for focused analysis.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: The dashboard displays important metrics such as average age, count of married individuals, and account balance.
- **Visualizations**: Includes heatmaps and histograms to visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Detailed Data View**: Users can view the detailed data in a tabular format.
